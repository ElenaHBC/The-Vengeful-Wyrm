It is a beautiful sunny day Wakefield and you are sitting at a corner table in the dimly lit tavern "Boar's Nest", enjoying a well-deserved rest and a mug of ale as midday sunlight filtered through the windows. 
The calm was abruptly shatteres when Thara burst through the door, her face flushed and eyes wide with panic. 
She rushes to you, clutching your arm and gasping, "You have to help! Dayereth has been taken by a Vengeful Wyrm while we were collecting herbs in the forbidden part of the forest!" 
Her words tumble out in a desperate rush, leaving no room for doubt or delay. 

The hero set down his mug, his expression shifting from calm to determined. 
"Show me where," he said, rising swiftly to his feet.
