It is a beautiful sunny day in Wakefield and you are sitting at a corner table in the dimly lit tavern "Boar's Nest", enjoying a well-deserved rest and a mug of ale as midday sunlight filtered through the windows. 
The calm was abruptly shatteres when Thara bursts through the door, her face flushed and eyes wide with panic. 
She rushes to you, clutching your arm and gasping, "You have to help! Dayereth has been taken by a Vengeful Wyrm!
We were in the forest, near the ancient oak, collecting herbs. We didn't realize we had strayed into the forbidden part where the wyrm rules. 
Suddenly, this huge shadow fell over us!" Her words tumble out in a desperate rush, leaving no room for doubt or delay. 
"I barely managed to escape. Heâ€™s still out there, in the wyrm's lair."
